    <h1>You Are Being Watched</h1>
    <br />
    <p>Every move you make online with your phone and computer are being watched and recorded by governments and corporations. Your privacy is non existent unless you learn to fight back! </p>
    <br>
    <h2>How are you being watched?</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Search Engines</li>
        <li>Phone Apps</li>
        <li>Location Tracking</li>
        <li>Image Meta Data</li>
        <li>Wifi Triangulation</li>
        <li>Social Media</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Search Engines</h2>
    Search engines such as Google and Bing keep a record of everything you search on the internet and where you go.
    <h2>Phone Apps</h2>
    Phone apps track you by accessing your location data and phone contacts.
    <h2>Location Tracking</h2>
    Everytime you use Google Maps, there is a record of where you have gone. Google has a huge database of everywhere anyone with an Android or Iphone that uses Google Maps. Research how many people were charged for the Jan. 6 Capital Building riots.
    <h2>Image Meta Data</h2>
    Every photo you take on your phone contains location data that can be accessed to know where that phone was taken.
    <h2>Wifi Triangulation</h2>
    There is a database of wifi routers that allows phones to know precisely where you are.  They are constantly looking for wifi signals to connect to and using that information to track you.
    <h2>Social Media</h2>
    Every social media company uses your personal data to sell advertising. You are the product. They also track you across the internet with code such as Facebook pixels to know exactly where you've gone. 
    <h2>Messaging</h2>
    The US government and others collect every text message sent over SMS and store them. Many messaging apps like WhatsApp are owned by large tech such as Meta and are not private even though they say they are. 
    <br>
    The problem is that we willingly and unknowingly give away are personal information without giving a second thought. It is by design.

    <h2>How do you fight back?</h2>
    If you want to, you can fight back. That's the first step. Becoming aware is the first way out of this matrix.
    This is a simple of list to start off as we build this site out.
    <br>
    <ul>
        <li>Browsers - don't use Google. Use a privacy focuses one such as Brave/Firefox or Tor.</li>
        <li>Search Engines - DuckDuckGo doesn't not keep a record of what you search for.</li>
        <li>Messaging - Signal is private by design.</li>
        <li> Social Media - don't use any Meta product. It's hard I'm sure if your friends and family are on there but they don't respect your privacy.  Your data is a product they sell. 
    </li>
    </ul>
